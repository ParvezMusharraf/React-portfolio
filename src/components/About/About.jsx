        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I recently completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Applications
          (BCA) in 2022. I have been working as a Front-End Developer and am
          eager to utilize my skills in a professional setting. I am a quick
          learner, a dedicated team member, and confident in my ability to
          contribute significantly to any web development team. During my tenure
          at Pixonix Software Technologies, I have honed my front-end
          development skills and acquired expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          ReactJS, Bootstrap, and Git/GitHub. Additionally, I have expanded my
          skill set to include back-end development with Node.js, Express, and
          MongoDB, thus transitioning into a Full Stack Developer role with
          nearly 6 months of experience. I am excited about the opportunity to
          bring my comprehensive skill set and passion for development to your
          team.
